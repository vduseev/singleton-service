# Tutorial

Welcome to the complete **singleton-service** tutorial! This step-by-step guide will take you from beginner to expert, covering all the essential concepts and patterns you need to build robust service-oriented applications.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Create singleton services with proper initialization
- ✅ Manage dependencies between services automatically  
- ✅ Implement health checks and error handling
- ✅ Build complex service architectures
- ✅ Test services effectively
- ✅ Follow best practices for production use

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.10+** installed
- **Basic Python knowledge** (classes, decorators, type hints)
- **singleton-service installed** (`pip install singleton-service`)

No prior dependency injection experience required!

*35 minutes* - Write comprehensive tests for your service architecture

## Learning Path

### For Beginners
Start with the first three tutorials to understand the fundamentals:
1. [Your First Service](first-service.md)
2. [Adding Dependencies](dependencies.md)  
3. [Initialization Order](initialization-order.md)

### For Intermediate Users
If you're familiar with dependency injection concepts, you can jump to:
1. [Health Checks](health-checks.md)
2. [Error Handling](error-handling.md)
3. [Testing Services](testing.md)

### For Advanced Users
Check out the [Advanced Topics](../advanced/) section for performance optimization, debugging, and complex patterns.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

!!! question "ImportError: No module named 'singleton_service'"
    Make sure singleton-service is installed: `pip install singleton-service`

!!! question "TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable"
    You need Python 3.10+. Check your version: `python --version`

!!! question "Examples don't work"
    Make sure you're running from the correct directory and have all imports.
