# Concepts

Deep dive into the core concepts and design principles behind **singleton-service**. This section explains the "why" behind the framework's design decisions and helps you understand when and how to apply different patterns.

## üß† Core Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you design better service architectures and use **singleton-service** effectively.

### üîó [The Singleton Pattern](singleton-pattern.md)
Learn about the singleton pattern, why it's useful for services, and how **singleton-service** implements it differently from traditional approaches.

**Key Topics:**
- What makes a good singleton
- Singleton vs global variables
- Thread safety considerations
- When to use (and not use) singletons

### üíâ [Dependency Injection](dependency-injection.md)
Understand how **singleton-service** implements dependency injection without the complexity of traditional DI frameworks.

**Key Topics:**
- Declarative dependency management
- Inversion of Control principles
- Comparison with other DI frameworks
- Dependency resolution algorithms

### ‚ö° [Service Initialization](initialization.md)
Master the service lifecycle, initialization patterns, and state management strategies.

**Key Topics:**
- Lazy vs eager initialization
- Initialization order guarantees
- State management best practices
- Performance implications

### üö® [Error Handling](error-handling.md)
Comprehensive guide to error handling philosophy, exception hierarchy, and failure recovery patterns.

**Key Topics:**
- Exception design principles
- Error propagation strategies
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Monitoring and observability

### üìã [Best Practices](best-practices.md)
Production-ready guidelines for designing, implementing, and deploying singleton services at scale.

**Key Topics:**
- Service design principles
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations
- Testing strategies
- Deployment patterns
